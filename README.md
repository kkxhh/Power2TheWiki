# Power2TheWiki
Final project for the Mining Massive Datasets course at UCU.

## Terminology
* **Page** - either an acual page in Wikipedia or a non-existing page having red links pointing to it (see Red Page).
* **Blue Page** - existing page of Wikipedia that has blue links pointing to it.
* **Red Page** - non-existing page of Wikipedia that has red links pointing to it.

## Notation
* **G-L** - graph of all pages of the Wikipedia in language L.
* **G-Lb** - graph of blue pages of the Wikipedia in language L.
* **V-L** - nodes of graph G-L. All pages of the Wikipedia in language L.
* **V-Ls** - pages of the Wikipedia in language L with status s Ñ” {b, r} (blue or red pages). V-Lb represents the nodes of graph G-Lb. V-Lb is a set of red pages. Graph G-Lr does not exist, because red pages don't have any outgoing links.
* **E-L** - edges of graph G-L. Links between all pages of the Wikipedia in language L.
* **E-Lb** - edges of graph G-Lb. Links between blue pages of the Wikipedia in language L.

## Problem statement
Among all red pages in the Wikipedia in language A find those that can be linked to some blue page in the Wikipedia in language B.

## Plan
1. Collect the data
2. Create the following graphs. In all graphs E = {links between pages}
    1. **G-EN**: V = {all pages of English Wikipedia}
    2. **G-UK**: V = {all pages of Ukrainian Wikipedia}
    3. **G-ENb**: V = {blue pages of English Wikipedia} (subset of EN)
    4. **G-UKb**: V = {blue pages of Ukrainian Wikipedia} (subset of UK)
    5. **G-Q**: V = {pages from ENb and UKb that are the translations of each-other}
3. Create the following subsets of nodes:
    1. **V-ENr** = {red pages from G-EN}
    2. **V-UKr** = {red pages from G-UK}
4. Baseline. Find the nearest neighbours for all nodes from V-ENr in V-UKb and for all nodes from V-UKr in V-ENb using the following similarity measures from graph theory
    1. Number of neighbours in common (a.k.a. mutual friends).
5. Create graph embeddings
6. Find the nearest neighbours for all nodes from V-ENr in V-UKb and for all nodes from V-UKr in V-ENb using graph embeddings
7. Compare the results to the baseline

## Research questions
1. If almost all red pages have only one incoming link from page X, the idea of graph isomorphism will make little sense because we will be looking for similarity based on a single common neighbour. And this means that any other neighbour of X would be a potential candidate.
    1. What is the average number of incoming links of red pages?
    2. What percent of red pages have the number of incoming links greater than some threshold = 3, 4, 5, ...?

## 1. Collecting the data
We have downloaded the full dumps of [English](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/20180620/) and [Ukrainian](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/ukwiki/20180620/) Wikipedia articles from 20/06/2018. Then we have parsed those articles to get outgoing red and blue links: the link article, text and position in the current article text. Also we have downloaded [Wiki interlanguage link records](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/ukwiki/20180620/ukwiki-20180620-langlinks.sql.gz) and parsed out all interlingual links between English and Ukrainian Wikipedia articles.
